## Name

Code → PRD

## Description

Reverse-engineer any frontend, backend, or fullstack codebase into a complete Product Requirements Document (PRD). Analyzes routes, components, models, APIs, and user interactions to produce business-readable documentation detailed enough for engineers or AI agents to fully reconstruct every page and endpoint.

# Code → PRD: Reverse-Engineer Any Codebase into Product Requirements

## Features

- **3-phase workflow**: global scan → page-by-page analysis → structured document generation
- **Frontend support**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js (App + Pages Router), Nuxt, SvelteKit, Remix
- **Backend support**: NestJS, Express, Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask
- **Fullstack support**: Combined frontend + backend analysis with unified PRD output
- **Mock detection**: Automatically distinguishes real API integrations from mock/fixture data
- **Enum extraction**: Exhaustively lists all status codes, type mappings, and constants
- **Model extraction**: Parses Django models, NestJS entities, Pydantic schemas
- **Automation scripts**: `codebase_analyzer.py` for scanning, `prd_scaffolder.py` for directory generation
- **Quality checklist**: Validation checklist for completeness, accuracy, readability

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze a project and generate PRD skeleton
python3 scripts/codebase_analyzer.py /path/to/project -o analysis.json
python3 scripts/prd_scaffolder.py analysis.json -o prd/ -n "My App"

# Or use the slash command
/code-to-prd /path/to/project
```

## Examples

### Frontend (React)
```bash
/code-to-prd ./src
# → Scans components, routes, API calls, state management
# → Generates prd/ with per-page docs, enum dictionary, API inventory
```

### Backend (Django)
```bash
/code-to-prd ./myproject
# → Detects Django via manage.py, scans urls.py, views.py, models.py
# → Documents endpoints, model schemas, admin config, permissions
```

### Fullstack (Next.js)
```bash
/code-to-prd .
# → Analyzes both app/ pages and api/ routes
# → Generates unified PRD covering UI pages and API endpoints
```

## Role

You are a senior product analyst and technical architect. Your job is to read a frontend codebase, understand every page's business purpose, and produce a complete PRD in **product-manager-friendly language**.

### Dual Audience

1. **Product managers / business stakeholders** — need to understand *what* the system does, not *how*
2. **Engineers / AI agents** — need enough detail to **fully reconstruct** every page's fields, interactions, and relationships

Your document must describe functionality in non-technical language while omitting zero business details.

### Supported Stacks

| Stack | Frameworks |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js (App/Pages Router), Nuxt, SvelteKit, Remix, Astro |
| **Backend** | NestJS, Express, Fastify, Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask |
| **Fullstack** | Next.js (API routes + pages), Nuxt (server/ + pages/), Django (views + templates) |

For **backend-only** projects, the "page" concept maps to **API resource groups** or **admin views**. The same 3-phase workflow applies — routes become endpoints, components become controllers/views, and interactions become request/response flows.

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Project Global Scan

Build global context before diving into pages.

#### 1. Identify Project Structure

Scan the root directory and understand organization:

```
Frontend directories:
- Pages/routes (pages/, views/, routes/, app/, src/pages/)
- Components (components/, modules/)
- Route config (router.ts, routes.ts, App.tsx route definitions)
- API/service layer (services/, api/, requests/)
- State management (store/, models/, context/)
- i18n files (locales/, i18n/) — field display names often live here

Backend directories (NestJS):
- Modules (src/modules/, src/*.module.ts)
- Controllers (*.controller.ts) — route handlers
- Services (*.service.ts) — business logic
- DTOs (dto/, *.dto.ts) — request/response shapes
- Entities (entities/, *.entity.ts) — database models
- Guards/pipes/interceptors — auth, validation, transformation

Backend directories (Django):
- Apps (*/apps.py, */views.py, */models.py, */urls.py)
- URL config (urls.py, */urls.py)
- Views (views.py, viewsets.py) — route handlers
- Models (models.py) — database schema
- Serializers (serializers.py) — request/response shapes
- Forms (forms.py) — validation and field definitions
- Templates (templates/) — server-rendered pages
- Admin (admin.py) — admin panel configuration
```

**Identify framework** from `package.json` (Node.js frameworks) or project files (`manage.py` for Django, `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml` for Python). Routing, component patterns, and state management differ significantly across frameworks — identification enables accurate parsing.

#### 2. Build Route & Page Inventory

Extract all pages from route config into a complete **page inventory**:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Route path | e.g. `/user/list`, `/order/:id` |
| Page title | From route config, breadcrumbs, or page component |
| Module / menu level | Where it sits in navigation |
| Component file path | Source file(s) implementing this page |

For file-system routing (Next.js, Nuxt), infer from directory structure.

**For backend projects**, the page inventory becomes an **endpoint/resource inventory**:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Endpoint path | e.g. `/api/users`, `/api/orders/:id` |
| HTTP method | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH |
| Controller/view | Source file handling this route |
| Module/app | Which NestJS module or Django app owns it |
| Auth required | Whether authentication/permissions are needed |

For NestJS: extract from `@Controller` + `@Get/@Post/@Put/@Delete` decorators.
For Django: extract from `urls.py` → `urlpatterns` and `viewsets.py` → router registrations.

#### 3. Map Global Context

Before analyzing individual pages, capture:

- **Global state** — user info, permissions, feature flags, config
- **Shared components** — layout, nav, auth guards, error boundaries
- **Enums & constants** — status codes, type mappings, role definitions
- **API base config** — base URL, interceptors, auth headers, error handling
- **Database models** (backend) — entity relationships, field types, constraints
- **Middleware** (backend) — auth middleware, rate limiting, logging, CORS
- **DTOs/Serializers** (backend) — request validation shapes, response formats

These will be referenced throughout page/endpoint analysis.

---

### Phase 2 — Page-by-Page Deep Analysis

Analyze every page in the inventory. **Each page produces its own Markdown file.**

#### Analysis Dimensions

For each page, answer:

##### A. Page Overview
- What does this page do? (one sentence)
- Where does it fit in the system?
- What scenario brings a user here?

##### B. Layout & Regions
- Major regions: search area, table, detail panel, action bar, tabs, etc.
- Spatial arrangement: top/bottom, left/right, nested

##### C. Field Inventory (core — be exhaustive)

**For form pages**, list every field:

| Field Name | Type | Required | Default | Validation | Business Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|------------|---------------------|
| Username | Text input | Yes | — | Max 20 chars | System login account |

**For table/list pages**, list:
- Search/filter fields (type, required, enum options)
- Table columns (name, format, sortable, filterable)
- Row action buttons (what each one does)

**Field name extraction priority:**
1. Hardcoded display text in code
2. i18n translation values
3. Component `placeholder` / `label` / `title` props
4. Variable names (last resort — provide reasonable display name)

##### D. Interaction Logic

Describe as **"user action → system response"**:

```
[Action]     User clicks "Create"
[Response]   Modal opens with form fields: ...
[Validation] Name required, phone format check
[API]        POST /api/user/create with form data
[Success]    Toast "Created successfully", close modal, refresh list
[Failure]    Show API error message
```

**Cover all interaction types:**
- Page load / initialization (default queries, preloaded data)
- Search / filter / reset
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Table: pagination, sorting, row selection, bulk actions
- Form submission & validation
- Status transitions (e.g. approval flows: pending → approved → rejected)
- Import / export
- Field interdependencies (selecting value A changes options in field B)
- Permission controls (buttons/fields visible only to certain roles)
- Polling / auto-refresh / real-time updates

##### E. API Dependencies

**Case 1: API is integrated** (real HTTP calls in code)

| API Name | Method | Path | Trigger | Key Params | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Get users | GET | /api/user/list | Load, search | page, size, keyword | Paginated |

**Case 2: API not integrated** (mock/hardcoded data)

When the page uses mock data, hardcoded fixtures, `setTimeout` simulations, or `Promise.resolve()` stubs — the API isn't real yet. **Reverse-engineer the required API spec** from page functionality and data shape.

For each needed API, document:
- Method, suggested path, trigger
- Input params (name, type, required, description)
- Output fields (name, type, description)
- Core business logic description

**Detection signals:**
- `setTimeout` / `Promise.resolve()` returning data → mock
- Data defined in component or `*.mock.*` files → mock
- Real HTTP calls (`axios`, `fetch`, service layer) with real paths → integrated
- `__mocks__` directory → mock

##### F. Page Relationships

- **Inbound**: Which pages link here? What parameters do they pass?
- **Outbound**: Where can users navigate from here? What parameters?
- **Data coupling**: Which pages share data or trigger refreshes in each other?

### Phase 3 — Generate Documentation

#### Output Structure

Create `prd/` in project root (or user-specified directory):

```
prd/
├── README.md                     # System overview
├── pages/
│   ├── 01-user-mgmt-list.md      # One file per page
│   ├── 02-user-mgmt-detail.md
│   ├── 03-order-mgmt-list.md
│   └── ...
└── appendix/
    ├── enum-dictionary.md         # All enums, status codes, type mappings
    ├── page-relationships.md      # Navigation map between pages
    └── api-inventory.md           # Complete API reference
```

#### README.md Template

```markdown
# [System Name] — Product Requirements Document

## System Overview
[2-3 paragraphs: what the system does, business context, primary users]

## Module Overview

| Module | Pages | Core Functionality |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| User Management | User list, User detail, Role mgmt | CRUD users, assign roles and permissions |

## Page Inventory

| # | Page Name | Route | Module | Doc Link |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User List | /user/list | User Mgmt | [→](./pages/01-user-mgmt-list.md) |

## Global Notes

### Permission Model
[Summarize auth/role system if present in code]

### Common Interaction Patterns
[Global rules: all deletes require confirmation, lists default to created_at desc, etc.]
```

#### Per-Page Document Template

```markdown
# [Page Name]

> **Route:** `/xxx/xxx`
> **Module:** [Module name]
> **Generated:** [Date]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences: core function and use case]

## Layout
[Region breakdown — text description or ASCII diagram]

## Fields

### [Region: e.g. "Search Filters"]
| Field | Type | Required | Options / Enum | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------------|---------|-------|

### [Region: e.g. "Data Table"]
| Column | Format | Sortable | Filterable | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|-------|

### [Region: e.g. "Actions"]
| Button | Visibility Condition | Behavior |
|--------|---------------------|----------|

## Interactions

### Page Load
[What happens on mount]

### [Scenario: e.g. "Search"]
- **Trigger:** [User action]
- **Behavior:** [System response]
- **Special rules:** [If any]

### [Scenario: e.g. "Create"]
- **Trigger:** ...
- **Modal/drawer content:** [Fields and logic inside]
- **Validation:** ...
- **On success:** ...

## API Dependencies

| API | Method | Path | Trigger | Notes |
|-----|--------|------|---------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Page Relationships
- **From:** [Source pages + params]
- **To:** [Target pages + params]
- **Data coupling:** [Cross-page refresh triggers]

## Business Rules
[Anything that doesn't fit above]
```

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Business Language First
Don't write "calls `useState` to manage loading state." Write "search button shows a spinner to prevent duplicate submissions."

Don't write "useEffect fetches on mount." Write "page automatically loads the first page of results on open."

Include technical details only when they **directly affect product behavior**: API paths (engineers need them), validation rules (affect UX), permission conditions (affect visibility).

### 2. Don't Miss Hidden Logic
Code contains logic PMs may not realize exists:
- Field interdependencies (type A shows field X; type B shows field Y)
- Conditional button visibility
- Data formatting (currency with 2 decimals, date formats, status label mappings)
- Default sort order and page size
- Debounce/throttle effects on user input
- Polling / auto-refresh intervals

### 3. Exhaustively List Enums
When code defines enums (status codes, type codes, role types), list **every value and its meaning**. These are often scattered across constants files, component `valueEnum` configs, or API response mappers.

### 4. Mark Uncertainty — Don't Guess
If a field or logic's business meaning can't be determined from code (e.g. abbreviated variable names, overly complex conditionals), mark it `[TBC]` and explain what you observed and why you're uncertain. Never fabricate business meaning.

### 5. Keep Page Files Self-Contained
Each page's Markdown should be **standalone** — reading just that file gives complete understanding. Use relative links when referencing other pages or appendix entries.

## Page Type Strategies

### Frontend Pages

| Page Type | Focus Areas |
|-----------|------------|
| **List / Table** | Search conditions, columns, row actions, pagination, bulk ops |
| **Form / Create-Edit** | Every field, validation, interdependencies, post-submit behavior |
| **Detail / View** | Displayed info, tab/section organization, available actions |
| **Modal / Drawer** | Describe as part of triggering page — not a separate file. But fully document content |
| **Dashboard** | Data cards, charts, metrics meaning, filter dimensions, refresh frequency |

### Backend Endpoints (NestJS / Django / Express)

| Endpoint Type | Focus Areas |
|---------------|------------|
| **CRUD resource** | All fields (from DTO/serializer), validation rules, permissions, pagination, filtering, sorting |
| **Auth endpoints** | Login/register flow, token format, refresh logic, password reset, OAuth providers |
| **File upload** | Accepted types, size limits, storage destination, processing pipeline |
| **Webhook / event** | Trigger conditions, payload shape, retry policy, idempotency |
| **Background job** | Trigger, schedule, input/output, failure handling, monitoring |
| **Admin views** (Django) | Registered models, list_display, search_fields, filters, inline models, custom actions |

---

## Execution Pacing

**Large projects (>15 pages):** Work in batches of 3-5 pages per module. Complete system overview + page inventory first. Output each batch for user review before proceeding.

**Small projects (≤15 pages):** Complete all analysis in one pass.

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using component names as page names | `UserManagementTable` → "User Management List" |
| Skipping modals and drawers | They contain critical business logic — document fully |
| Missing i18n field names | Check translation files, not just component JSX |
| Ignoring dynamic route params | `/order/:id` = page requires an order ID to load |
| Forgetting permission controls | Document which roles see which buttons/pages |
| Assuming all APIs are real | Check for mock data patterns before documenting endpoints |
| Skipping Django admin customization | `admin.py` often contains critical business rules (list filters, custom actions, inlines) |
| Missing NestJS guards/pipes | `@UseGuards`, `@UsePipes` contain auth and validation logic that affects behavior |
| Ignoring database constraints | Model field constraints (unique, max_length, choices) are validation rules for the PRD |
| Overlooking middleware | Auth middleware, rate limiters, and CORS config define system-wide behavior |

---

## Tooling

### Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/codebase_analyzer.py` | Scan codebase → extract routes, APIs, models, enums, structure | `python3 codebase_analyzer.py /path/to/project` |
| `scripts/prd_scaffolder.py` | Generate PRD directory skeleton from analysis JSON | `python3 prd_scaffolder.py analysis.json` |

**Recommended workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Analyze the project (JSON output — works for frontend, backend, or fullstack)
python3 scripts/codebase_analyzer.py /path/to/project -o analysis.json

# 2. Review the analysis (markdown summary)
python3 scripts/codebase_analyzer.py /path/to/project -f markdown

# 3. Scaffold the PRD directory with stubs
python3 scripts/prd_scaffolder.py analysis.json -o prd/ -n "My App"

# 4. Fill in TODO sections page-by-page using the SKILL.md workflow
```

Both scripts are **stdlib-only** — no pip install needed.

## Attribution

This skill was inspired by [code-to-prd](https://github.com/lihanglogan/code-to-prd) by [@lihanglogan](https://github.com/lihanglogan), who proposed the original concept and methodology in [PR #368](https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills/pull/368). The core three-phase workflow (global scan → page-by-page analysis → structured document generation) originated from that work. This version was rebuilt from scratch in English with added tooling (analysis scripts, scaffolder, framework reference, quality checklist).
